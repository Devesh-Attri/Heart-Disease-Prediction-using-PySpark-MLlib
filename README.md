# Heart Disease Risk Prediction System
A scalable **Heart Disease Risk Prediction System** built using **PySpark** for big data processing and powerful machine learning models (**XGBoost**, **KNN**, and **ANN**). The system predicts the risk of heart disease based on user health metrics like **BMI**, **blood pressure**, and more, enabling early detection and prevention.
